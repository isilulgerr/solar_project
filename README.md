Intelligent Solar Energy System
This project involves developing an Intelligent Solar Energy System to optimize the use of solar power in various environments, including homes and factories. The system leverages embedded hardware and software to increase efficiency and provide users with convenient control and monitoring capabilities.

Features
Real-time Monitoring: Displays temperature, humidity, battery, and system status on an OLED and LCD screen.
Smart Sensing: Uses LDR Photoresistor and DHT-22 sensors to detect sunlight, temperature, and humidity, adjusting the system for maximum efficiency.
User Interaction:
Control the system manually via a slide switch and keypad.
Receive alerts with a buzzer for any system issues.
Panel Automation: A servo motor automates panel mechanisms for better sunlight tracking.
Hardware Used
Arduino Mega: Microcontroller for system control.
SSD1306 OLED Display: Displays temperature, humidity, and system information.
LCD Screen: Provides menu and system status.
DHT-22 Sensor: Measures temperature and humidity.
LDR Photoresistor: Detects sunlight intensity.
Servo Motor: Adjusts panel angles.
Buzzer: Alerts users to system issues.
Software
Developed using Arduino C.
Simulated and tested using the WOKWI Online Emulator.
Purpose
This intelligent system aims to enhance solar panel efficiency, simplify user interaction, and provide real-time monitoring and control capabilities, making it ideal for homes and industrial setups.
